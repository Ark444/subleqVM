BINARY FILE FORMAT DOCUMENTATION

========================================

ASM:

The asm will compile an assembly file and convert it to a binary readable by subleqVM

Program file:

	prog = {
		".text": [opcode, opcode, ..., ],
		".data": ["Hello world!\n", "str2"],
		"mem": 32,
		"prog_size": len(.text) + len(.data) + stack,
		"inst_size": 128,
	}

Program file contains a pickle() object of the above json.

User controled:
	.text: list of opcodes ; each opcode represents the 3 operands of the subleq instruction, encoded on 3 words each.
	.data: bytearray ; data to be loaded in memory
	mem: int ; minimal memory required by the program

Compiler controlled:
	prog_size: int ; size of loaded program: sizeof(.text) + sizeof(.data) + mem + gaps
	inst_size: int ; equivalent to architecture nb of bits (32, 64...) except it is the result 2**bits

=======================================

LOADER:

The loader takes a program and loads it in memory so the VM can exec it.

prog at exec time:

	0x0									0xsize
 	|SYS|.text   | | .data | |  mem      |
	Â¦___|________|_|_______|_|___________|
	 <--------------size---------------->

assert prog_size <= mem_size, "Memory Error: not enough memory"

<SYS>:
	0x00: HALT (if set to 0)
	[0x01, 0x0f]: unused
	[0x10, 0x1f]: General registers, noted from r0 to rf.
	[0x20, 0x2f]: SYScall utilites
				  - 0x20: WR: if the value written in this word is > 0, it will be printed at next tick on stdout.

				  - 0x21: SYS_RDA: address for read
				  - 0x22: SYS_RDL: length to read ; length read.
				  - 0x23: SYS_RDC: Control Register for READ Syscall: if > 0, will read from stdin and copy SYS_RDL bytes at @SYS_RDA
				  				When something have been read, its length is returned into SYS_RDL

				  - 0x24: SYS_RND: provides a random value at each tick.
				  - 0x25: unused.

Prog:
	[0x30, SIZE]:
		.text 	is loaded at @0x30
		.data	is loaded at @0x30 + sizeof(.text) + GAP
		mem 	is loaded at @.data + sizeof(.data) + GAP

		GAP is arbitrary and does not serve any purpose yet.
