ASM SYNTAX DOCUMENTATION
========================

SECTIONS:

A section is defined by the keyword 'section' and a name:

```
 section test
```

There are only one mandatory section which is '.text'

.text contains the executable code.
.data contains program data that will be loaded after the .text section.
mem is just a section containing a value of the minimal memory required by the program.

A section ends where another starts, or if we reach EOF.

========================

LABELS:

A label references a value, it is a name followed by '=', that can be followed by a value

```
	test=42
	test2=
```

Those are both valid. However, if no value is specified the value will be init to 0.
