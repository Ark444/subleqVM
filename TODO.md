# TODO

## Features

1. Add some syscall read
	* somehow populates SYS_RD with stdin
	* we can also have control registers for thoses? ==> allowing for blocking reads and controled output

3. ASM
	* create a grammar for asm files so that it becomes less of a pain to write
	* using pyparsing would be great

4. Docs

## Debug


## Enhancement

1. Implement PIE in the loader

2. refactor the loader to another class
