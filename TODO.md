# TODO

## Features
1. Add some syscalls -> write / read
	* we could have a register whose value will be print at each tick? // maybe only when value > 0
	* same thing for read
	* we can also have control registers for thoses? ==> allowing for blocking reads and controled output


## Debug

## Enhancement

1. add verbose option that will trigger dump()
2. find a better bytecode format?
